///DISCLAIMER
We will not include legendary pokemons for players fairness (if legendary = true in csv, refuse choice).

We will not include all of the pokemons abilities, just 4 per types, and 2 of each if a pokemon has 2 types.
The abilities are included in the pok_moves.csv that we filled in from a real database.

This is not a realistic or faithful representation of pokemon's gameplay, and it surely is inaccurate and false.
